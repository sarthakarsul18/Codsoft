"# Movie Rating Prediction" 
"This project predicts IMDb ratings of Indian movies using a RandomForestRegressor model. The dataset "IMDb Movies India.csv" includes features like Genre, Director, Actors, Duration, Votes, and Rating. To use this project, clone the repository, place the dataset in the project directory, install the required dependencies (pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib, scikit-learn, joblib), and run the script. The model achieves a Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 0.071 and an R-squared (R2) score of 0.618. The trained model is saved as best_model.pkl, and the results, including a scatter plot of Actual vs Predicted Ratings, are visualized. Contributions are welcome, and the project is licensed under the MIT License."
